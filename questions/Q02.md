## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer

For what:

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It is commonly used for encoding data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with text. This includes data transfer over protocols like HTTP, email, and other text-based communication systems.

For why:

1. **Text Format:**
   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) need to be transmitted as part of URLs, HTTP headers, or other text-based systems. Base64 encoding converts the binary data into a plain text format, making it suitable for such use cases.

2. **Compact Representation:**
   Base64 encoding produces a compact representation of data, which is crucial because tokens are often included in HTTP headers. A compact token minimizes the data overhead.

3. **Standardized:**
   Base64 is a well-established and standardized encoding scheme, ensuring that encoded tokens can be correctly interpreted and decoded by different systems and languages.
