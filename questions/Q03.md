## Question

What two pieces of information are used to construct the signature for a JWT?

## Answer

The signature is the result of a hashing function that takes in 2 parameters: the encoded header and payload separated by a dot, and a "secret phrase". The secret is just a string of text that only the server knows, kind of like a password.

Example:

```js
const header = {
  alg: "HS256",
  typ: "JWT",
};

const payload = {
  id: 13,
  username: "nathank",
};

const secret = "just_a_string_of_text";

const signature = HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
);
```
